# OS-Scheduler
# The OS scheduler is a crucial part of the operating system responsible for CPU scheduling.
This involves selecting a process from the ready queue and assigning the CPU to it based on
specific criteria, primarily the chosen scheduling algorithm and whether it is preemptive or
non-preemptive. The dispatcher, a key component of the OS scheduler, handles the actual
allocation of CPU resources to the selected process.
